## Project Overview

Overview
In this project, you will make use of Python to explore data related to bikeshare systems for three major bikeshare systems in the United States. You will perform data wrangling to unify the format of data from the three systems and write code to compute descriptive statistics. You will also make use of a package that is not part of the standard Python library to help you visualize the data.

If you are not familiar with the data analysis process, this project will be your first exposure to the kinds of steps that a data analyst takes when they approach a dataset. The steps of the process that you go through here will be covered in more depth as you continue on with the Nanodegree program. For now, all you need is the general programming skills you've learned from the "Introduction to Python Programming" course and a desire to learn about the data analysis process! Note that you may not have seen some of the packages used in the project prior to this point, so you should be comfortable with following documentation links and experimenting with code to build your intuition for how to use the packages to solve the problems posed.

## How to Read Report

1. If your PC got [```jupyter```](https://jupyter.org/) installed. then you can checkout this project in you machine, and open the ```Bike_Share_Analysis-zh.ipynb``` or ```Bike_Share_Analysis.ipynb``` file with ```jupyter```.
2. If you do not have ```jupyter``` installed, then you can open ```Bike_Share_Analysis-zh.html``` or ```Bike_Share_Analysis.html``` in your browser.
